# graphql-service
A production-grade **GraphQL API** built with **Spring Boot** and **Spring for GraphQL**, showcasing clean architecture, pagination, filtering, and JWT-based authentication. The domain is intentionally simple (Products, Customers, Orders) so the focus stays on GraphQL best practices and backend craftsmanship.
